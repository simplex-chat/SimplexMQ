# SMP agent groups

## Problems

- device/user profile synchronisation
- chat group communication

Both problems would require message broadcast between a group of SMP agents.

## Solution: basic symmetric groups via SMP agent protocol

Additional commands and message envelopes to SMP agent protocol to provide an abstraction layer for device synchronisation and chat groups.

The groups are fully symmetric, all agent who are members of the group have equal rights and can join and leave group at any time.

All the information about the groups is stored only in agents, the commands are used to synchronise the group state between the agents.

```abnf
group_command = create_group / add_to_group / remove_from_group / leave_group
group_response = group_created / added_to_group / removed_from_group
group_notification = added_to_group_by / removed_from_group_by / left_group
create_group = %s"GNEW " group_name ; cAlias must be empty
add_to_group = %s"GADD " group_name ; cAlias is the connection to add to the group
added_to_group = %s"GADDED " name ; cAlias is the connection added to the group
```
