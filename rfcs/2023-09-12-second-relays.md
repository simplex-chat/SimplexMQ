# Protecting IP addresses of the users from their contacts

## Problem

SMP protocol relays are chosen and can be controlled by the message recipients. It means that the recipients can find out IP addresses of message senders by modifying SMP relay code (or by using proxies and timing correlation), unless the senders use VPN or some overlay network. Tor is an adequate solution in most cases to mitigate it, but it requires additional technical knowledge to install and configure (even installing Orbot on Android is seen as "complex" by many users), and reduces usability because of higher latency.

The lack of in-built IP address protection is the main concern of many users, particularly given that most people do not realize that it is lacking by default - without transport protection SimpleX is not perceived as a "whole product".

Similarly, XFTP protocol relays are chosen by senders, and they can be used to detect file recipients' IP addresses.

## Possible solutions

1. Embed Tor in the client.

Pros:
- no changes in the protocols/servers
- acceptable threat model for most users
- removes complexity of installing and configuring Tor
- probably, the most attractive option for Tor users

Cons:
- higher latency and error rate
- higher resource usage
- requires us updating Tor client regularly
- restriction on Tor usage in some networks, so it would require supporting bridges in the app UI
- legislative restrictions on Tor usage, so it may require supporting multiple app versions, and won't solve the problem where Tor is not embedded

2. Thin clients with hosted accounts.

Host some part of the current client on the server and have another part running on the devices.

Pros:
- substantially reduces the traffic for mobile clients
- probably the most attractive option for mass market users who expect to have an account on the server and be able to access it from multiple devices and via web.

Cons:
- a lot of design and development
- makes accounts visible to the server
- the new protocol design to protect connections graph and message content from the hosting server.
- quite different threat model

Overall, this is not a viable or even appropriate option for the current stage.

3. SMP / XFTP proxy.

Introduce SMP and XFTP protocol extensions to allow message senders and file recipients to delegate the tasks of sending messages and receiving files to the proxies, so that peer-chosen relays can only observe IP addresses of the proxies and not of the users.

Pros:
- no dependency on and lower latency than via Tor
- reduces client traffic, both due to retries handled by these proxies and due to the smaller number of connections to the peer-chosen relays. The flip side is that additional commands (and traffic) are needed to create the sessions with relays.
- higher transport privacy: protects IP addresses from peers and makes transport correlation harder.
- additional function: retrying pending messages, while the queue is not secured yet, without extra traffic for the clients.
- improves current threat model by preventing session-based correlation of the traffic by the destination relay (assuming no information sharing with the proxies), as there will be one session between proxy and destination relay, mixing traffic from multiple users.

Cons:
- design and development cost
- can undermine delivery stability

This seems an attractive option, both from technical (reasonable complexity) and positioning (moving SimpleX closer to mix networks, while still avoiding server list visibility) points of view, and it is in the middle between embedding Tor, which would make the product more niche and has downsides and development costs too, and thin clients, which is 10x+ more work, and also creates a different threat model, that is not very attractive for the current stage and users.

Below considers this design.

## SMP/XFTP proxy design

### Design requirements

1. To avoid increasing the complexity of self-hosting, we should not create additional server types, and existing SMP and XFTP servers should be extended to provide proxy functions.

2. SMP proxy should not be able to observe queue addresses and their count on the destination relays. This requirement is not needed for XFTP proxies, as each file chunk is downloaded only once, so there is no need to hide its address.

3. There must be no identifiers and ciphertext in common in outgoing and incoming traffic inside TLS (the current designs have this quality).

4. Traffic between the client and destination relays must be e2e encrypted, with MITM-by-proxy mitigated, relying on the relay identity (certificate fingerprint), ideally without any additional fingerprint in relay address.

5. SMP proxy should implement retry logic and hold messages while they are delivered. They also should return relay replies to the client. To avoid any additional traffic the client should just add "sent to proxy" status and only show "sent" once proxy returns the response from the destination relay - there should be no additional response from the proxy confirming acceptance to delivery.

This would also reduce the difference in how the traffic looks to the observer - sending via proxy may look similar to sending to the usual server (which can be further supported by friendly destination relays that could add latency for direct requests and reply quickly when response came via proxy and be undermined by hostile relays that would introduce some latency pattern to help traffic correlation. The latter problem can be mitigated by having a fixed response latency from proxy that may be "come back later for destination response").

6. Sending messages to groups have to be batched in the client to avoid multiple requests for destination relay sessions - such requests can be batched to proxy, even though it leaks _some_ metadata - which destination relays are used by a given sender's IP address, it also reduces the overhead from proxies â€“ it could be an option based on the privacy slider.

6. SMP proxy may also increase utility and privacy of the platform:

- holding messages and retrying them for the new connections while the receiving queue is not secured yet.
- add delays in message delivery to make traffic correlation harder (same can be done in SMP relays).

### Implementation considerations

1. Block size. Possibly, there is not enough spare capacity in the current 16kb block to fit additional headers, any necessary metadata and encryption authentication tags, in which case we cannot send SMP and SMP-proxy traffic in the same transport connection (in case the same server plays both roles). In which case we will need to negotiate role during connection handshake and define a different (sub-)protocol for SMP-proxy.

2. To be decided if we see it as extension of SMP protocol or as another protocol, irrespective of whether it's provided by the same or another server. Given different roles and block size it may be simpler to see it as a separate protocol, and which protocol is provided in the connection is determined during handshake.

3. We probably should aim to avoid changing agent/client logic and see it instead as transport concern that can be dynamically decided at a point of sending a message, based on the current configuration.

4. Configuration should probably allow to choose between not using proxies (particularly, during testing, when it would be the default), using proxies only for unknown relays, and using proxies for all relays (extra traffic, but more complex transport correlation - although randomizing this choice can be more beneficial to the transport privacy). The clients can aim to use proxy from another provider, to reduce the risks of sharing the information.

### SMP-proxy protocol

The flow of the messages will be:

1. Client requests proxy to create session with the relay by sending `PRXY` command with the SMP relay address and optional proxy basic AUTH (below). It should be possible to batch multiple session requests into one block, to reduce traffic.

2. Proxy connects to SMP relay, negotiating a shared secret via a handshake headers - it will be used to encrypt all sender blocks inside TLS (proxy-relay encryption). DH key returned by SMP relay in handshake will also be used to encrypt client commands, combining it with random per-command keys (sender-relay encryption, to hide metadata sent to the destination relay from proxy).

3. Proxy replies to sender with `PKEY` message using "entityId" transmission field to indicate session ID for using in further requests, relay DH key for _s2r_ encryption with the client - this key is signed with the TLS online private key associated with the certificate (its fingerprint is included in the relay address), and the TLS session ID between proxy and relay (this session ID must be used in transmissions, to mitigate replay attacks as before).

A possible attack here is that proxy can use this TLS session to replay commands received from the client. Possibly, it could be mitigated with a bloom filter per proxy/SMP relay connection that would reject the repeated DH keys (that need to be used for replay), and also with DH key expiration (this mitigation should allow some acceptable rate of false positives from the bloom filter).

With 32 bits per key there will be ~1/1,000,000 false positives (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom_filter), and the filter would use ~32mb per each proxy connection if we reset relay key every 1000000 messages or more frequently. Given that the only commands accepted via relay would be SEND, replaying it would be interpreted by the receiving client as duplicate message delivery, so a small number of replayed messages won't cause any problems. But without mitigation it could be used to flood the receiving SMP relay queues with repeated messages, effectively causing DoS on these queues, even in case when SMP relays require basic auth to create queues.

Given that the client chooses proxy it has some trust to, maybe this replay attack risk can be accepted.

It is important that the same public key from destination relay is returned to all clients, so proxy does not need to repeat this request to know relays while the key did not expire, as using different keys for different clients would allow destination relays to correlate requests to the clients. A proxy that colludes with the destination relay can pass different public keys to the same client, but it is not changing threat model as colluding proxy can share information as well. It is also important that the client uses a new random key for each command, as using the same key would allow the destination relay to identify these commands as comming from the same user, and using a different key for each queue while would protect privacy of the user from the destination relay, would make it visible to the proxy how many different queues the client has on destination relay.

*Unrelated cosideration for SMP protocol privacy improvement*: instead of signing commands to the destination relay, the sender could have a ratchet per queue agreed with the destination relay that would simply use authenticated encryption with per-message symmetric key to encrypt the message on the way to relay, and this encryption would be used as a proof of sender.

4. Now the client sends `PFWD` to proxy, which it then forwards to SMP relay as `RFWD`, applying _p2r_ encryption layer.

5. SMP relay sends `RRES` to proxy applying _p2r_ encryption layer, which it then forwards to the client as `PRES`, removing the _p2r_ encryption layer.

Effectively it works as a simplified two-hop onion routing with the first relay (proxy) chosen by the sending client and the second relay chosen by the recipient, not only protecting senders' IP addresses from the recipients' relays, but also preventing recipients' relays from correlating senders' traffic to different queues, as TLS session is owned by the proxy now and it mixes the traffic from multiple senders. To correlate traffic to users, proxy and relay would have to combine their information. SMP relays are still able to correlate traffic to receiving users via transport session.

Below diagram shows the encrypttion layers for `PFWD`/`RFWD` commands and `RRES`/`PRES` responses:

- s2r (added) - encryption between client and SMP relay, with relay key returned in relay handshake, with MITM by proxy mitigated by verifying the certificate fingerprint included in the relay address.
- e2e (exists now) - end-to-end encryption per SMP queue, with double ratchet e2e encryption inside it.
- p2r (added) - additional encryption between proxy and SMP relay with the shared secret agreed in the handshake, to mitigate traffic correlation inside TLS.
- r2c (exists now) additional encryption between SMP relay and client to prevent traffic correlation inside TLS.

```

Question: should proxy declare its role in handshake? When proxy connects to SMP relay it would indicate in the handshake that it will act as a proxy and the SMP relay would expect the same `forward` commands and reply with `response`s.

Common SMP transmission format (v4), for reference:

```abnf
paddedTransmission = <padded(transmission), 16384>
transmission = signature signed
signature = 0 ; empty signatures here
signed = sessionIdentifier corrId entityId (smpCommand / brokerMsg)
```

- `corrId` is fully random each time and used as a nonce for encrypted blocks.
- `entityId` carries tlsUniq from the current proxy-to-relay connection.
- `smpCommand` gets extended with `s2p_command / p2r_command`.
- `brokerMsg` gets extended with `r_key / r_response`.

```abnf
s2p_command = proxy / forward
p2r_command = p_handshake ; forward is
proxy = %s"PRXY" SP relayUri SP basicAuth
relayUri = length %s"smp://" serverIdentity "@" srvHost [":" port]
forward = %s"PFWD" SP dhPublic SP encryptedBlock
r_key = %s"PKEY" SP dhPublic
r_response = %s"RRES" SP encryptedBlock
dhPublic = length x509encoded
```

The above assumes that the client can only send one message to an SMP relay and then has to wait for response before sending the next message. Missing the response would cause re-delivery (further improvement is possible when proxy detects these redelieveries and not send them to relays but simply reply with the same response).

### Implementation considerations for the client

While client/server protocol is rather straightforward to implement, and it is already working, there are some decisions to make about how the client makes decisions about.

1. When to use proxy and when to connect directly to the destination relay.

While from the perspective of threat model improvement it may be beneficial to always use the proxy, choosing the proxy that is different from other relays in the connection, initially we need to make it opt-in, with an option to only use it for unknown destination relays, to minimize any unexpected adverse effect on the delivery latency.

Proxy mode will be passed from the client via NetworkConfig.

2. Which proxying relays to use.

Ability to request access to the session with the destination relay (and to create such session) is protected with the same basic auth approach as creating queues - the logic here is that opening private servers to all users as proxies would increase the scenarios for DoS attacks (which is the case with the public servers).

The open question is whether the client should choose proxies from:
- all configured relays.
- there should be a subset of configured relays.
- there should be a separate list.

E.g., there could be a second toggle in the relay configuration to allow using relay as proxy, in addition to the current toggle that allows creating queues.

For simplicity, initially we will just use all enabled relays as potential proxies.

3. How many proxying relays should be used during one session.

This is not a simple question, and it creates a contradiction between two risks:
- collusion between proxies and destination relays simplifies correlating sending clients by session - from the point of view of this risk, clients should follow the same policy for creating connections with proxies, that is to create a new connection for each user profile, and if transport isolation is set to "per connection" - for each destination queue.
- traffic correlation by observable traffic sessions (particularly if an attacker can observe user's ISP traffic or multiple proxies) - from this point of view, it would be beneficial to use fewer proxies and fewer connections with proxies and see the risk of proxy colluding with the destination relay as lower than the risk of traffic observation that in the case of multiple sessions would allow to correlate traffic to rarely used destination relays (any private self-hosted relays) and the traffic of the user to a given proxy, to prove the fact of user communicating with the destination relay via the proxy.

While we can transfer this choice on the users, it seems a complex decision to make, and overall the second risk (traffic correlation) seems more important to address than the first.

In any case possible options are:
1. Extreme option 1: Create a new proxy session, with the new random proxy, for each potential transport session that would exist if the user were to be connected to destination relays directly. That is, never to mix access to multiple relays from multiple user profiles (and in case of per-connection isolation, to multiple queues) into a one client session with proxy. This is a rather radical option that nullifies any advantages of having fewer sessions with proxies than there would have been with the destination relays and removes any benefits of batching destination server session requests (PRXY comands).
2. Extreme option 2: Use only one proxy session at the time, mixing traffic from all user profiles and to all destination servers (and for all queues) into a session with one proxy. This minimizes the risks of traffic correlation in case of non-colluding proxy, but maximises the risk in case it colludes with the destination relays.
3. Balanced option: Use one proxy session per user profile, but mix traffic to multiple queues irrespective of connection isolation option and to all destination servers. Given that connection isolation is an experimental option, this makes the most sense, but it would have to be disclosed.
4. Less balanced option: take connection isolation option into account and create a new proxy connection for each destination queue. This feels worse than option 3.

If option 3 is chosen, then the transport session key with the proxy would be different from the transport session key with the relay - proxy session will only use UserId as the key, and the relay session uses (UserId, Server, Maybe EntityId) as the key.

If option 4 is chosen, the keys would also be different, as the proxy would then use (UserId, Maybe (Server, EntityId)) as the key.

We could potentially key proxy sessions (and create proxy connections) per each destination relay, in the same way as we key relays themselves, but it seems to have the least sense, as we neither achieve isolation by queue in case proxy and destination relay collude, nor we sufficiently protect from traffic correlation by any observers.

The implemented design is this:
- for each destination relay a random proxy is chosen and used to send all messages - all requests from a client coalesce to a single session.
- transport isolation mode is taken into account, that is if per-connection isolation is enabled, then a separate proxy connection will be created for each messaging queue.
- supported modes when proxy is used: always, for unknown relays, for unknown relays when IP address is not protected, never.

This decision is made because the argument for protection against collusion between proxy and relay and more balanced traffic distribution is stronger than the argument for protection against traffic correlation, because even mixing all messages to one proxy connection does not provide protection against traffic correlation by time, so in any case it requires adding delays.

### Threat model for SMP proxy and changes to threat model for SMP

#### SMP proxy

*can:*

- learn a user's IP address, as long as Tor is not used.

- learn when a user with a given IP address is online.

- know how many messages are sent from a given IP address and to a given destination SMP relay.

- drop all messages from a given IP address or to a given destination relay.

- unless SMP relay detects repeated public DH keys of senders, replay messages to a destination relay within a single session, causing either duplicate message delivery (which will be detected and ignored by the receiving clients), or, when receiving client is not connected to SMP relay, exhausting capacity of destination queues used within the session.

*cannot:*

- perform queue correlation (matching multiple queues to a single user), unless it has additional information from SMP relay.

- undetectably add, duplicate, or corrupt individual messages.

- undetectably drop individual messages, so long as a subsequent message is delivered.

- learn the contents of messages.

- learn the destination queues of messages.

- distinguish noise messages from regular messages except via timing regularities.

- compromise the user's end-to-end encryption with another user via an active attack.

- compromise the user's end-to-end encryption with destination relay via an active attack.

#### SMP relay accessed via SMP proxy

*still can:*

- perform recipients' queue correlation (matching multiple queues to a single recipient) via either a re-used transport connection, user's IP Address, or connection timing regularities

*no longer can:*

- perform senders' queue correlation (matching multiple queues to a single sender) via either a re-used transport connection, user's IP Address, or connection timing regularities, unless it has additional information from SMP proxy.

- learn a sender's IP address, track them through other IP addresses they use to access the same queue, and infer information (e.g. employer) based on the IP addresses, even if Tor is not used.

The rest of the threat model for SMP relays remains the same as in [overview](../protocol/overview-tjr.md#simplex-messaging-protocol-server).
