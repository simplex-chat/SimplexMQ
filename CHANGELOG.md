# 4.4.1

SMP agent:

- fix handling of server addresses.
- prevent message delivery getting stuck on IO error in SMP client.

# 4.4.0

SMP agent:

- support multiple user profiles with transport session isolation.
- support optional transport isolation per connection.
- batch connection deletion
- improve asynchronous connection deletion â€“ it may now be completed after the client is restarted as well.
- improve subscription logic to retry if initial attempt fails.
- end SMP client connection after a number of failed PINGs (default is 3).

# 4.3.0

SMP server:

- additional server usage statistics.

SMP agent:

- increase retry interval when sending messages after ERR QUOTA.

# 4.2.0

SMP agent and server:

- reduce sender traffic in cases when queue quota is exceeded:
  - server sends quota exceeded message to the recipient when sender receives ERR QUOTA.
  - recipient sends QCONT message to the send once the queue is drained (via reply queue).
  - sender retry delays are increased, reducing traffic, but sender instantly resumes delivery where QCONT is received.

SMP server:

- increase internal queue sizes.

SMP agent:

- deduplicate connection IDs in connect/disconnect responses.
- unit tests for Crypto.hs.
- fix connection switch to another queue: correctly set primary send queue.

Notification server (v1.3.0):

- check token status when sending verification notification.

# 4.1.0

SMP agent and server:

- option to toggle TLS handshake error logs (disabled by default).

SMP agent:

- include server address in BROKER error.
- api to get hash of double ratchet associated data (for connection verification).
- api to get agent statistics.

# 4.0.0

SMP server:

- Basic authentication. The server address can now include an optional password that is required to create messaging queues, so the contacts who message you will not be able to receive messages via your server, unless you share with them the address with the password. It is recommended to enable basic authentication on all private servers by adding `create_password` parameter into AUTH section of server INI file (the previously deployed servers do not have this section, you need to add it).
- Disable creating new queues completely with `new_queues: off` parameter in AUTH section of INI file - it can be used to simplify migrating the existing connections to another server.
- Updated server CLI with changed defaults:
  - interactive server initialization, use -y flag to initialize the server non-interactively.
  - store log is now enabled by default, so messaging queues and messages are restored when the server is restarted (to restore undelivered messages the server needs to be stopped with SIGINT signal).
  - a random password is now generated by default during the server initialization.

SMP agent:

- API to test SMP servers. It connects to the server, creates and deletes a messaging queue. The new SimpleX Chat client uses this API to allow you to test that you have the correct server address, with the valid certificate fingerprint and password, before enabling the new server.

  - update NKEY and NID to add e2e encryption keys (for the notification meta-data encryption between SMP server and the client), and update NMSG to include this meta-data.
  - update ACK command to include message ID (to avoid acknowledging unprocessed message).
  - add NDEL commands to remove notification subscription credentials from SMP queue.

SMP server:

- disconnect inactive clients after some period
- remove undelivered messages after 30 days
- log aggregate usage daily stats: only the number of queues created/secured/deleted/used and messages sent/delivered is logged, as one line per day, so we can plan server capacity and diagnose any problems.

SMP agent:

- manage device tokens and notification server connection
- DOWN/UP events to the agent user about server disconnections/reconnections are now sent once per server

- Switch from hs-tls fork to original repo now that it supports getFinished and getPeerFinished APIs for both TLS 1.2 and TLS 1.3.

SMP server:

- Perform TLS handshake in a separate thread per-connection.

SMP agent:

- Cease attempts to send HELLO after one week timeout.
- Coalesce requests to connect to SMP servers, to have 1 connection per server.

# 1.0.1

SMP server:

- Explicitly set line buffering in stdout/stderr to log each line when output is redirected to files.

# 1.0.0

Security and privacy improvements:

- Faster and more secure 2-layer E2E encryption with additional encryption layer between servers and recipients:
  - application messages in each duplex connection (managed by SMP agents - see [overview](https://github.com/simplex-chat/simplexmq/blob/master/protocol/overview-tjr.md)) are encrypted using [double-ratchet algorithm](https://www.signal.org/docs/specifications/doubleratchet/), providing forward secrecy and break-in recovery. This layer uses two Curve448 keys per client for [X3DH key agreement](https://www.signal.org/docs/specifications/x3dh/), SHA512 based HKDFs and AES-GCM AEAD encryption.
  - SMP client messages are additionally E2E encrypted in each SMP queue to avoid cipher-text correlation of messages sent via multiple redundant queues (that will be supported soon). This and the next layer use [NaCl crypto_box algorithm](https://nacl.cr.yp.to/index.html) with XSalsa20Poly1305 cipher and Curve25519 keys for DH key agreement.
  - Messages delivered from the servers to the recipients are additionally encrypted to avoid cipher-text correlation between sent and received messages.
- To prevent any traffic correlation by content size, SimpleX uses fixed transport block size of 16kb (16384 bytes) with padding on all encryption layers:
  - application messages are padded to 15788 bytes before E2E double-ratchet encryption.
  - messages between SMP clients are padded to 16032 bytes before E2E encryption in each SMP queue.
  - messages from the server to the recipient are padded to padded to 16088 bytes before the additional encryption layer (see above).
- TLS 1.2+ with tls-unique channel binding in each command to prevent replay attacks.
- Server identity verification via server offline certificate fingerprints included in SMP server addresses.

New functionality:

- Support for notification servers with new SMP commands: `NKEY`/`NID`, `NSUB`/`NMSG`.

Efficiency improvements:

- Binary protocol encodings to reduce overhead from circa 15% to approximately 3.7% of transmitted application message size, with only 2.2% overhead for SMP protocol messages.
- More performant cryptographic algorithms.
